I’m Pat, and I have a car problem.

I often find myself spewing off car nonsense to my girlfriend, so maybe a blog would be a better place to exhaust myself. Pun intended.

Everyone has got the passion, but mine has unfortunately turned itself into an obsession that is difficult to suppress. So here I am, sharing some thoughts on the vast and ever-growing subject. But what do you get out of it?

Maybe you’re curious about what its like to really “wring-out” a car on a racetrack, and are looking for tips. 

Maybe you have seat time and are looking to modify your car to get faster.

Maybe you like taking photos like I do. 

Maybe you’re curious about how I made this obsession my career. I have a first-hand, insider look on the industry, and can try to point you in the right direction. We’re in the learning process together, as all engineers, drivers, and photographers are – Let’s discuss.

Let’s learn together, and learn from each other. "Carcaine" is much more fun with friends.
